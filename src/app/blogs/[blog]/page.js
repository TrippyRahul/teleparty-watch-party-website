If you are wondering how to use Scener extension, Then, similar to the Teleparty Watch Party, everyone needs to install the Scener Chrome extension. The key difference is that only 50 people can join a watching room, whereas in a Teleparty Watch Party, unlimited people can join. You can invite your family and friends to join a party by sending them a URL link that is generated by Scener. After that, you can stream your movie night and watch Netflix together. ",

In Scener, there is a feature where only one user can be in control at a time, indicated by a small remote icon in the chat window. The person who is hosting has all the control, and only he/she can browse services like Netflix, HBO, or Disney Plus. When playback begins, it automatically syncs up for everyone, but there is a twist: each participant needs to manually press play after the host initiates playback. ",

But one notable usability difference is that the Teleparty Watch Party allows you to go full screen without any issues. However, in Scener, to achieve full-screen mode, you must use the control+up shortcut (on Mac) or alt+tab (on Windows) to manually move the chat windows into the fullscreen playback window. Without doing this, you will find yourself watching the video with no chat to read. You can also install the Scener app on your mobile phone and have your small Scener TV in your comfort zone.  ",

Unlike some other extensions, where you can only watch a movie of someone else’s choice, with these two, everyone can watch their own stream. The cool thing is that it also works in the background to make sure that everyone stays in sync. The only thing is that because of the chat bar on the side of the screen, the video can’t use the whole screen, and that’s not a big problem at all.",
